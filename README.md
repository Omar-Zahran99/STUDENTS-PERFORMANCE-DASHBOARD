# üéì Students Performance Dashboard

> **Summary:**  
> Analyzed student exam data using Python and Power BI to identify key performance factors and visualize insights through an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven educational decisions.

## üåç Situation
Educational institutions often struggle to understand which factors most affect students‚Äô academic performance.  
Without actionable insights, it becomes challenging to design targeted interventions or improve teaching strategies effectively.

---

## üéØ Task
As a **Data Analyst**, I set out to:
- Explore and analyze student performance data to identify patterns and influential factors.  
- Evaluate how demographics, parental education, and study habits impact exam results.  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** that allows educators and decision-makers to easily explore insights and make informed decisions.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Action
To achieve these goals, I implemented a structured data analysis workflow:

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Imported the dataset into Python.
   - Handled missing values, standardized column names, and converted data types for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performed descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.
   - Used `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` to visualize performance distributions by gender, parental education, and preparation level.

3. **Insight Extraction**
   - Identified key correlations between preparation courses, study habits, and exam outcomes.
   - Highlighted subject-wise performance differences and high-variance areas.

4. **Dashboard Development**
   - Designed a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize the data interactively.
   - Included filters for gender, education level, and test preparation to enable dynamic exploration of results.

## üìà Result
- Found that **parental education** and **test preparation** were strong predictors of student success.  
- Discovered that **Math scores** had the highest variability, suggesting targeted improvement opportunities.  
- Delivered a **fully interactive Power BI dashboard** to help educators monitor trends and drive strategic decisions.

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support better educational planning and student achievement.
